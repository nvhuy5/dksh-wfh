class RequestIDMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    """
    Middleware to assign a unique UUID as a request ID for each incoming HTTP request.

    The request ID is added to the response headers as `X-Request-ID` to facilitate
    tracing and correlation of logs and requests across distributed systems.

    Usage:
        Add this middleware to your FastAPI or Starlette application to enable
        consistent request tracing.

    Example:
        app.add_middleware(RequestIDMiddleware)
    """

        self, request: Request, call_next: Callable[[Request], Awaitable[Response]]

        # Set context with request_id (you can pass document_number later if needed)
        # set_context_values(request_id=request_id)

        response = await call_next(request)
